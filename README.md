# first_side_project

Leo has read the book, which is 'learn the git for yourself' <br>
try to edit the README.md <br>
Leo has uploaded the .gitignore
learn how to commit this README.md
0722 I have push a new version to GitHub 'add superuser'
0725 I have build the 'Post' in both admin.py & models.py
I should see the 'post → 文章‘ on the page 'localhost:8000/admin' which I have not.
Would you tell me what's wrong with this?
